Array is a collection of items of the same variable type that are stored at contiguous memory locations.
Basic terminologies of Array:

    Array Index: In an array, elements are identified by their indexes. Array index starts from 0.
    Array element: Elements are items stored in an array and can be accessed by their index.
    Array Length: The length of an array is determined by the number of elements it can contain. 

Types of Array

There are two main types of arrays:
I.Memory Location:
1. Static Arrays: int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; 
2. Dynamic Arrays:int* arr = new int[5];
II.Dimension:
    1.One-dimensional arrays: These arrays store a single row of elements.
    2.Multidimensional arrays: These arrays store multiple rows of elements.

Array Operations

Common operations performed on arrays include:

    Traversal: Visiting each element of an array in a specific order (e.g., sequential, reverse).
    Insertion: Adding a new element to an array at a specific index.
    Deletion: Removing an element from an array at a specific index.
    Searching: Finding the index of an element in an array.

Applications of Array

Arrays are used in a wide variety of applications, including:

    Storing data for processing
    Implementing data structures such as stacks and queues
    Representing data in tables and matrices
    Creating dynamic data structures such as linked lists and trees



    A subarray is a contiguous part of array, i.e., Subarray is an array that is inside another array.
    n*(n+1)/2 


    A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by removing zero or more elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements.
    (2n – 1)


    If a Set has all its elements belonging to other sets, this set will be known as a subset of the other set.
